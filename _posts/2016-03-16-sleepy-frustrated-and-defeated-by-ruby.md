title: Sleepy, frustrated and defeated by Ruby
---

I say defeated by Ruby, that’s not quite correct. I’m yet to reach a stage where I could be defeated by Ruby as I have struck a wall installing it on my computer. I was following this Codemy video to a t, but it all went wrong when I saw three numbers; 2.0.0. Specifically:

>ruby 2.0.0p645 (2015-04-13 revision 50299) [universal.x86_64-darwin15]

But, I didn’t install 2.0.0. I installed 2.3.0, I can clearly see the line:

>‘Installed ruby-2.3.0 to /usr/local/var/rbenv/versions/2.3.0′.

But. Why?

It’s 1:30am and certainly not the best time to worrying about this. I’ll try again in the morning.

*sigh*

Update

The install simply didn’t work, hence the version being stated as the version that was already on the computer, ruby 2.0.0. After a re-install, all was well.
