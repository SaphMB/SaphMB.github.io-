title: Deployed! (and Unemployed)
---

Despite toying around with HTML and CSS for years now, I’d ever actually built and deployed a website. Until now! A very sudden change in circumstances led me to finally finish building and deploying my personal website. That change in circumstance? I was made redundant.

After some frustration, followed by a bit of sadness, I ended up here:

It’s not the end of the world, and I’ve had time to get a lot of coding done. First thing was getting my website done which is currently serving as an online CV. And I was able to flex by Bootstrap muscles.

Also, in two days, I’ve made more progress with JQuery than I have in months.

To redundancy!
